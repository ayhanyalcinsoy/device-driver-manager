    <h1>Device Driver Manager</h1>

    <div class="main">
    <h2>[Description]</h2>
    <p>The Device Driver Manager is a tool to help users installing third-party hardware drivers.<br>
    Currently Nvidia, ATI and Broadcom drivers can be installed and allows to install the PAE kernel for multi-core 32-bit systems.<br>
    The Device Driver Manager will only list those devices that are supported. It will not list any other devices then mentioned above.<br></p>


    <h2>[Important]</h2>
    <p>The Device Driver can only install drivers which are available in the repositories. <br>
    Make sure you have an internet connection if you want to install the drivers.<br></p>


    <h2>[Files]</h2>
    <p>If you prefer to install the drivers by terminal, you can use the following commands:</p>

    <p><b># install-ati</b><br>
    This will install the fglrx drivers for your ATI graphical card.<br>
    ATI cards from version HD 5000 and up are supported by the fglrx drivers. <br>
    Versions between 1000 and 5000 will use the Radeon drivers.<br>
    If you want to remove these drivers, you can run the install-nouveau command (see below).<br></p>

    <p><b># install-nvidia</b><br>
    This will select the right drivers for your Nvidia graphical card.
    It will select the Bumblebee drivers in case you have a hybrid card (both Nvidia and Intel).<br>
    If you want to remove these drivers, you can run the install-nouveau command (see below).<br></p>

    <p><b># install-nouveau</b><br>
    You can use this command if you want to revert back to the open Nouveau drivers.<br>
    It will remove any proprietary drivers from your system.<br></p>

    <p><b># install-broadcom<br>
    # install-broadcom purge</b><br>
    This command will install the right driver for your wireless Broadcom adapter.<br>
    Use the "purge" argument to remove the drivers from your system.<br></p>

    <p><b># install-pae<br>
    # install-pae purge</b><br>
    This will install the PAE kernel on multi-processor systems running a 32-bit OS.<br>
    Use the "purge" argument to remove the PAE kernel from your system.<br>
    Note that you cannot remove the kernel when you are currently booted into that kernel.<br></p>
